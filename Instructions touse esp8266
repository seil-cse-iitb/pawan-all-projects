Instrustion to programm ESP 8266 -
Firm ware programming :-

Putting Device Into Flash Mode:-

To enable ESP8266 firmware flashing GPIO0 pin must be pulled low before the device is reset. Conversely, for a normal boot, GPIO0 must be pulled high or floating.

If you have a NodeMCU dev kit then you don't need to do anything, as the USB connection can pull GPIO0 low by asserting DTR and reset your board by asserting RTS.

If you have an ESP-01 or other device without built-in USB, you will need to enable flashing yourself by pulling GPIO0 low or pressing a "flash" switch, while powering up or resetting the module.

Which Files To Flash:-

If you build your firmware with the cloud builder or the Docker image, or any other method that produces a combined binary, then you can flash that file directly to address 0x00000.

Otherwise, if you built your own firmware from source code:

bin/0x00000.bin to 0x00000
bin/0x10000.bin to 0x10000

The default init data is provided as part of the SDK in the file esp_init_data_default.bin. NodeMCU will automatically flash this file to the right place on first boot if the sector appears to be empty.

If you need to customize init data then first download the Espressif SDK 2.1.0 and extract esp_init_data_default.bin. Then flash that file just like you'd flash the firmware. The correct address for the init data depends on the capacity of the flash chip.

0x7c000 for 512 kB, modules like most ESP-01, -03, -07 etc.
0xfc000 for 1 MB, modules like ESP8285, PSF-A85, some ESP-01, -03 etc.
0x1fc000 for 2 MB
0x3fc000 for 4 MB, modules like ESP-12E, NodeMCU devkit 1.0, WeMos D1 mini
0x7fc000 for 8 MB
0xffc000 for 16 MB, modules like WeMos D1 mini pro

How to send files to esp and how to write application level programms on the device in lua

For lua documentation please refer this link:-
https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/master/

This link gives all the proper code snipts and example that are very important while programming esp using lua.
* If you want to include any "X" package in your programm please add the package while creating the firm ware.
